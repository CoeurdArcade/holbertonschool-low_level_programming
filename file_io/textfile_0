In the realm where the whispers of time are kept,
Where shadows dance and the silent secrets sleep,
I wandered far, where the ancient winds had swept,
And found a tale that the ages had reaped.

Beneath the moon's silver, ghostly light,
A path unwound, leading into night,
Through forests deep and valleys shrouded in fright,
I followed on, guided by stars that burn bright.

A castle stood, by the cliffs of despair,
Its towers tall, reaching for the cold air,
Within its halls, an echo of laughter rare,
And ghosts of memories that none could repair.

The lord of the keep, a figure of stone,
His heart frozen, his eyes hollow and alone,
He ruled in silence, his spirit turned to bone,
A prisoner bound in a kingdom of his own.

Yet once he loved, with a passion so pure,
A maiden fair, with a smile that could cure,
The darkest night, the most dismal allure,
Her spirit burned, a flame that would endure.

But fate conspired, with a cruel, twisted hand,
To tear them apart, to sever their band,
And in the void, where love's light once had planned,
There remained naught but the echo of a brand.

The lord, in grief, built walls of stone and ice,
His heart a fortress, a sacrifice,
To the pain that cut like a blade so precise,
He vowed to love nevermore, at any price.

Yet still, I heard, in the hush of the night,
A whisper soft, a plea for the light,
A call to redeem, to make everything right,
To free the spirit from its endless plight.

So I stepped forth, with a heart open wide,
And offered warmth to the lord who had died,
Inside his soul, where the shadows reside,
A spark of hope, a love to confide.

Through the long nights, I sang songs of old,
Of heroes brave, and tales yet untold,
And slowly, the ice began to unfold,
Revealing the man who had once been so bold.

His eyes, once cold, now burned with a fire,
A flame rekindled, a newfound desire,
To live, to love, to embrace what transpired,
And in that moment, his spirit took flight.

The castle walls crumbled, the shadows retreated,
The ghosts of the past, finally defeated,
And in their place, a new world was created,
Where love and laughter forever were seated.

So let this tale, in your heart, find a home,
A testament to the power of love's gentle glow,
For even in darkness, where hope seems unknown,
A spark can ignite, and a new life bestow.

And as I left, with the dawn's golden light,
I knew that the lord and his love were reunited,
Their spirits entwined, in a dance ever bright,
A testament to the love that had ignited.

So walk with faith, through the shadows of night,
And believe in the power of love's pure light,
For even in darkness, it shines ever bright,
A beacon of hope, in the endless fight.
