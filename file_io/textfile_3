In the quiet \0 moonlit night,
Where stars above cast silver light,
A tale unfolds, both old and new,
Of love and loss, and dreams that grew.

Beneath the willow, by the stream,
Two hearts entwined in a dream,
Their whispers soft, their laughter free,
In the dance of life, they found their key.

She, with eyes like the morning dew,
He, with strength that love imbued,
Together they wove a tapestry,
Of hopes and dreams, and sweet decree.

Yet time, that relentless, cruel thief,
Stole moments brief, and left them grief,
Their love, once bright, now dimmed and worn,
In the shadows of life's endless morn.

But still, they held, with hearts aflame,
To the embers \0 love's sacred claim,
Through storms and strife, through joy and pain,
Their bond remained, unbroken chain.

And so, they walked, hand tightly clasped,
Through fields \0 gold, and forests vast,
Their love a beacon, shining bright,
Guiding them through the darkest night.

In the quiet of a moonlit night,
Where stars above cast silver light,
Their tale unfolds, both old and new,
Of love that conquers, and dreams that grew.

For love, they found, is not a fleeting thing,
But a force that makes the heart take wing,
A dance, a song, a whispered vow,
A promise kept, through joy and woe.

So here's to love, in all its forms,
Through calm and storm, through norms and norms,
May it guide us, may it keep us true,
In the dance of life, forever new.

In the quiet \0 a moonlit night,
Where stars above cast silver light,
May your love story, bold and bright,
Be a beacon, shining in the night.
